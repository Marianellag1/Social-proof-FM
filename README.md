## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I have a hard time with media queries, and although we went over it in bootcamp, its still something I need to mess with and get used to. It's something extremely useful and helpful.But I am happy to have some success with this challenge with media query. 

Very helpfull code:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .Container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

What I would like to continue in development with this challenge, is: user-friendly view aka media query. Although it looks great on some screen sizes, I would like it to show the same on different screens.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - It's a very great site for basic understanding of code. Extremely helpful when a simple css code can help change anything in a website.
- [stackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49471488/stacking-divs-using-media-queries) - Very thankful for those questions asked and more to those that have answered with helpfull code.
